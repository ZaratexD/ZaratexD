### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**UW Applied & Computational Mathematical Sciences: Data Science & Statistics**

I am a Junior studying ACMS: Data Science at the University of Washington Seattle. I enjoy using programming as a tool
to help me achieve my goals, express my creativity, and push the boundaries of cutting-edge technology like AI/ML.

I have taken a special interest in ML working on the DeepTracer[https://deeptracer.uw.edu/home] program with Data Analysis & Intelligent Systems (DAIS) @ UW.
Here we aim to bring Machine Learning techniques to predict protein structures pushing innovation in applied technology to 
life science.

Developing, planning, and working towards a common goal takes a lot of work. I am using my **GitHub** to showcase the skills I have
learned and how they apply to the research I am assisting with as well as show my dedication to proper Software Development.
